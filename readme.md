## Demo

This demo project demonstrates the following key features:

* **Exporting models using a Python script**

  * See `ScriptUtils\Config\readme.md` for setup instructions.
  * Add your configuration with the following fields:

    ```json
    {
      "unity_project_root": "Unity/Flag",
      "blender_path": "your_path_to_blender"
    }
    ```

* **Shader Graph implementation for a flag effect**

  * `LitFlag`: A simple lit shader using a color tint
  * `LitFlagTexture`: A version that combines texture sampling with color tinting


## Features

* ðŸš© **No cloth simulation** â€” uses a lightweight shader-based waving effect (faster and more GPU-friendly)
* ðŸ§­ **Works in object space** â€” the flag animation remains consistent even when the object is rotated
* ðŸŽ¨ **Color support via `MaterialPropertyBlock`** â€” allows dynamic per-object coloring without duplicating materials (ideal for batching and memory efficiency)
